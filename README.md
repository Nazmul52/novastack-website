## 🎨 Design Rationale

This project emphasizes clean, modern design with a focus on user experience. I implemented a consistent color system using Tailwind's custom theme, created reusable component patterns for maintainability, and added scroll animations for visual engagement. The design balances professionalism with creativity, using gradients and smooth transitions to create a premium feel while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility.
